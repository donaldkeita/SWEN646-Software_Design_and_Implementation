# SWEN646-Software_Design_and_Implementation

An exploration of modern software development techniques, tools, and technologies for building large,
complex systems. Topics include software development processes and the role of design in those
processes. Discussion also covers major design methods, available computer-aided software engineering
(CASE) tools, the proper application of design methods, and techniques for estimating the magnitude of the
development effort. Object-oriented programming is presented. Focus is on building software products
using these technologies.
